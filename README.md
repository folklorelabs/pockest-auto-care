# Pockest Auto-Care

## What is this?

This is an [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script that automatically cares for [Street Fighter Pockest Monsters](https://www.streetfighter.com/6/buckler/minigame).

It does this by systematically clicking the specified care options (FOOD, CURE, CLEAN) and then will attempt to TRAIN a specified skill (Power, Speed, or Technique). By default, this cycle is performed every minute. Care options, training, and timings can all be customized.

Shout out to the [Pockest Guide on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3003515624&tscn=1698405122) and their Discord community.
